Welcome to the hackaton repo
=====

Welcome! I've written a small introduction in hope that you will understand what I'm trying to do with this. As well as a guide on how you could get started collaborating on this project. If you are only interested in the guide, read the hackaton-app / hackaton-server part of this readme.

##What is the site suposed to do?
The hackaton site is suposed to be a tool of us moving forward. Where we can share information, create suggestions for projects that we could make happen, and a place where we could easily organize a hackaton.

> If you have any suggestions for how to make this site better even better. Please spit it out so that we can improve the site.

###Site map

* [Projects](#projects)
* [Collaborators / The team](#collaborators-the-team)
* [Calendar](#calendar)
* [Playlists](#playlists)
* [Git repo](#git-repo)

####Projects
Here we can come with suggestions on what we could make. Start planing out how a product could *look*, *feel*, *work*, *function*, *sell*, *earn us gold*, or whatever. So that we have a more solid base when we are starting a hackaton. 
>It could also be a preview of past work.

####Collaborators / the team
A place where we can list everyone that are a part of the hackaton team. Have *image*, *name*, *special abilities*, *bio* for everyone. 

####Calendar
A place where everyone can post days that they could potentially do a hackaton. So that the ogranizers could try and make it happen.

####Playlists
Basically playlists that we could colaborate on. So that we could have a good variety in music when we are doing a hackaton.

##Hackaton-app
If you want to help build a solid, good looking, sexy piece of frontend. Then you should be working in the *hackaton-app* folder. 

**HTML**, **SCSS**, **JavaScript**, **assets**, and more are located here. 

>More information about how to get started with the frontend can be found inside the *README.md*; in the hackaton-app folder.


##Hackaton-server
If you are more interested in doing backend server stuff, then you should be working in this folder. Here I am planing on building a solid **Node CRUD API server**. With **KOA** as wrapper. 

>More information about how to get started with the server can be found inside the *README.md*; in the hackaton-server folder.
