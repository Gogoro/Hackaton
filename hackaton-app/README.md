Welcome to the frontend where babies are burned and lives lived. **I will be your guide.**

##Getting started

####Prerequisists:
The first step of the process is to have the required services running on your machine. You need to have these installed whether you use Mac, Linux or Windows.

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) or [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)

####Initialization [MAC osX and Linux]:
1. Clone this repository into your desired location:
<code>git clone https://github.com/Gogoro/Hackaton.git</code>

2. Change git remote path to your desired location <code>git remote set-url urlhere.git</code>

3. Point you localhost / vhost to <code>(repo-location)/hackaton-app/app</code>

4. Use your terminal and cd into this folder: <code>(repo-location)/hackaton-app/</code>

5. run <code>$ npm install</code> to install the required node modules
