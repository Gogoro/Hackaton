Hackaton-App
========
Welcome to the frontend where babies are burned and lives lived. **I will be your guide.**

##Getting started

####Prerequisists:
The first step of the process is to have the required services running on your machine. You need to have these installed whether you use Mac, Linux or Windows.

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) or [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)

####Initialization [MAC osX and Linux]:
1. Point you localhost / vhost to <code>(repo-location)/hackaton-app/app</code>
2. Use your terminal and cd into this folder: <code>(repo-location)/hackaton-app/</code>
3. run <code>$ npm install</code> to install the required node modules
3. run <code>$ gulp</code> for compiling sass, livereload, ++

> **Notes:**
> Make sure you use a stable version of node.
>
> Ask [Gogoro](https://github.com/Gogoro) if you have problems initializing the site on your machine.

####Initialization [Windows]:
1. Point you localhost / vhost to <code>(repo-location)/hackaton-app/app</code>
2. run the <code>windows-install.bat</code> to install the required node modules
3. run the <code>windows-run.bat</code> to run gulp for compiling sass, livereload, ++

> **Notes:**
> Make sure you use a stable version of node.
>
> I don't usually develop on windows so if you got problems installing / running the application. Please contact [Gogoro](https://github.com/Gogoro) so he can fix the problem.
